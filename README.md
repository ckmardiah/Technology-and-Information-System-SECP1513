**Reflection on SECP1513-Technology and Information System Course**
## ‚ú® **Reflection Essay: My Learning Journey in Technology and Information System (SECP1513)**

As I'm looking back and remisniscence throughout my study over this course , I have found that it has been a meaningful and eye-opening experience for me. It has strengthened my foundation in IT and help me create a proper pathway for me to procced into my next journey in thie field.In Addition, This course not only enhanced my theoretical understanding of core IT concepts but also gave me practical exposure through assignments and insightful industry talks.

In the first few chapters, I learned about the **evolution of information technology**, beginning with the early days of vacuum tube computers, leading up to modern innovations like **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and the **Internet of Things (IoT)**. This historical progression especially the six major eras has helped me appreciate how technology has rapidly evolved and how it continues to shape our daily lives, industries, and careers. The discussion on **hardware components** and the jigsaw assignment provided me with a hands-on understanding of how each part of a computer component  works together to perform tasks efficiently.Its also expose to me the function of each component and their importance.This has help me get a better grasp of a Computer .

Next, is the chapter on **software** .It helped me to distinguish between system, application, programming, and malicious software. It was especially insightful to learn how programs are written in human-readable languages to control machines.In addition it as It‚Äôs truly astonishing to see how programming languages, though seemingly simple in structure, can be used to create such a wide range of software and applications ‚Äî from the smallest everyday tools to the most complex systems that power industries and global technologies.Generative AI tools like ChatGPT have made a tremendous impact, giving people a vison of the future. Many now among tech enthusiasist envision that we are entering a new era where AI will play a key role in supporting human progress and driving the next phase of technological evolution.Given that there are many area that still in latent phase and waiting for breakthrough .This chapter has inspire me to be one of the person who spearheaded this evolution.Its make me realise how vast the Software. 

Through learning about **Information Systems and methodologies**, I discovered how organizations use structured systems to make informed decisions, manage resources, and maintain data integrity. Plus , I realise the importance of flow of the infromation from TOP to Down in the organization hierarchy .This naturally flowed into my understanding of **databases and data analytics**, where I realized that data organization is just the starting point ‚Äî true value comes from analyzing that data to uncover patterns and make decisions.

Chapters on **networking and communication**, **privacy and security**, and **cloud computing** made me aware of the technical and ethical responsibilities of IT professionals. I now understand how important it is to ensure secure, reliable communication between systems and how cloud services have transformed how we store and access information globally.

Beyond the classroom content, the **Industry Talks** were a standout part of this course. The session on **navigating the ICT job market** highlighted global vs local opportunities and the importance of both technical and soft skills.I learn how tough the current ICT job  due to disruption technology such as Generative AI,co-pilot and etc .These tools are very capable in doing the simple apps just by using a prompt.As a student i learn the need to adapt and work with Generative AI in order to be relevance in job market .This discussion also give me a beter insight about the reality of job market and the neccesary skill set that will set me apart from my competitor and appear attractive in employer eyes.I also learned that communication, teamwork, and adaptability are just as crucial as technical know-how in succeeding in the tech field.

Another session on **university vs. industry** bridged the gap between academic learning and real-world expectations. This is crucial and difficult challenge as the university need to adapt to the continous ever changing landscape of an iT Industry. Based on this , i have undestand how the University adapt to this challenge and doing their best to provide relevant skills and theory to the student.By enabling them in learning the relevant trending skill set and future skill. It reminded me that while knowledge gained in university is foundational, continuous learning, upskilling, and hands-on experience are essential for long-term growth.

The **burnout and work-life balance talk** resonated deeply with me. It addressed real challenges faced by IT professionals and emphasized the need for self-care and positive coping strategies to sustain a healthy career. Lastly, the discussion on **Generative AI** opened my eyes to the future of tech innovation. It sparked my curiosity about how AI is not only transforming jobs but also creating new opportunities for creative problem-solving and collaboration.This innovation will be a great evolution of human industry and how we work .
